### ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance)

ANCOVA is a blend of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression. It is similar to factorial ANOVA, in that it can tell you what additional information you can get by considering one independent variable (factor) at a time, without the influence of the others.

I am to determine whether there are significant between groups and within subject differences in each of the physiological variables (including Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, measured as systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure) while controlling for potential confounding demographic and/or health variables (Gender, Age, Family History of Alcoholism, Smoking Habits, Drug Addiction, Alcoholism, Drinks Alcohol, Mental Illness, Race/Ethnicity).
